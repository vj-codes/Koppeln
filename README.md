# Koppeln

## Inspiration
I asked a few small business owners and social media influencers from my city what the most difficult part owning a business or being an influencer in 2021? Most of the answers were that it is very difficult gaining the trust of brands and sponsors which helps in increasing their online presence through the brand's deals which eventually leads to one of the major sources of profits in their respective ventures. 
So, to make it easier for influencers to network and communicate with sponsors and brands, I came up with the idea of Koppeln, whose main motive is to bridge the gap between the influencers/owners and the sponsors/brands.

## What it does
On this web app, a representative of a specific brand can create an account and share what kind of influencers or businesses they are looking to collaborate with.
Once an influencer creates an account too, they will see the brands and contact them through the chat feature leading to growing their online presence as well as generate more revenue and this can be done easily just through a few clicks.
Koppeln is the German word for 'connect and hence the project name.

## How we built it
Koppeln is built using React, Material UI, and Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into
I was using Firebase for the first time ever and it was a bit challenging for me to integrate it with my project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am really proud of completing the project in just 48 hours and never thought an MVP can be created in such a short time by me.

## What we learned
Firebase integration in real-life projects

## What's next for Koppeln
Mobile support and UI improvement
